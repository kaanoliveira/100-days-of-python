# TODO-1 - Update the word list to use the word_list from hangman_words.py
# TODO-2 - Update the code to use the stages from the file hangman_art.py
# TODO-3 - Import the logo from hangman_art.py and print it at the start of the game
# TODO-4 - If the user has entered a letter they've already guessed, print the letter and let them know. We should not deduct a life for this. 
# TODO-5 - If the letter is not in chosen_word, print out the letter and let them know it's not in the word. E.g. You guessed  d, that's not in the word. You lose a life. 
# TODO-6 - Update the code below to tell the user how many lives they have left
